# v_refresh - Current (June 2026 re-run)

All targets are hypotheses. Mark as [? hypothesis]. Unknown = [?].

---

## Acquisition

**Channels and mechanics:**
- Organic search (SEO): content around "subscription tracker," "how to cancel X subscription," "am I overpaying for subscriptions," "best subscription tracker app 2026"
- Social content (TikTok, Instagram Reels, Reddit): UGC-style content showing the discovery moment
- Reddit communities: r/personalfinance, r/frugal, r/UKPersonalFinance
- Word of mouth: friend showing a friend the subscription list reveal
- Privacy-first content angle (NEW): "track subscriptions without giving up your bank data" - validated by ReSubs' content strategy and Google Play growth. Source: [resubs.app/resources](https://resubs.app/resources)
- App store / ProductHunt listing: meaningful for awareness in this category
- Paid social (later stage): retargeting after organic validates messaging

**Key hypotheses:**
1. The "subscription reveal" moment is shareable content - a count or total ("I found 14 subscriptions I forgot about - $247/month") will drive organic sharing [? hypothesis]
2. SEO around "subscription tracker" and "how to cancel X subscription" will capture high-intent users cheaply [? hypothesis]. NEW: "no bank subscription tracker" and "private subscription tracker" are emerging SEO terms based on ReSubs content. Source: [resubs.app/resources/best-free-subscription-trackers](https://resubs.app/resources/best-free-subscription-trackers)
3. The product does not need paid acquisition in early stages if the free tier delivers genuine value for referrals [? hypothesis]

**What's unknown:**
- Whether Reddit and TikTok audiences convert at meaningfully different rates
- Whether "subscription tracker" or "spending tracker" is the better anchor term
- CPAs for paid social in this category
- Whether "privacy-first" messaging attracts a meaningfully larger audience than "convenient auto-detect" messaging [?]

**Primary metric:** New signups per week
**Target:** 100 signups/week within 3 months [? hypothesis]

**v_refresh MVP product decision:** Build a shareable subscription snapshot. ALSO build a landing page with explicit dual messaging: "Connect your bank for instant results" and "Start without connecting - takes 2 minutes." Both paths must be visible above the fold. Evidence: ReSubs' "no bank required" positioning drives its Google Play rating of 4.5 from 718 reviews. Source: [resubs.app](https://resubs.app/)

## Activation

**Channels and mechanics:**
- Onboarding path A (bank-connected): connect Plaid/TrueLayer, auto-import subscriptions, see list immediately
- Onboarding path B (privacy-first): AI import from screenshot/Gmail OR manual entry - leads to same aha moment via a longer but trust-first route. NEW: ReSubs' 461 preset subscriptions for quick setup is the benchmark for how fast manual can be. Source: [resubs.app](https://resubs.app/)
- "Aha moment" trigger: the first time the user sees a populated subscription list with a monthly total
- Progressive disclosure: both paths defer all configuration, profile setup, and feature explanations until after the aha moment

**Key hypotheses:**
1. The subscription list + total is the activation event regardless of which path delivered it. The path changes friction level, not the emotional payoff [? hypothesis]
2. Path A (bank-connected) reaches the aha moment faster but has a higher drop-off at the trust barrier. Path B (privacy-first) has lower drop-off at entry but higher effort before value. Both are needed [? hypothesis]
3. Users who see at least 5 subscriptions in their first session (via any path) are significantly more likely to return within 7 days than users who see 1-2 [? hypothesis]
4. NEW: Offering path B prominently at onboarding start (not just as a small "skip" link) will increase total activation by 15-25% by capturing users who would otherwise abandon at bank connection [? hypothesis]. Evidence: ReSubs built their entire product on path B and reached 18K+ users. Source: [resubs.app](https://resubs.app/)

**What's unknown:**
- What % of users choose bank connection vs. privacy-first path when both are offered equally [?]
- Whether AI screenshot import (ReSubs-style) reduces effort enough to match bank-connected activation quality [?]
- Optimal number of subscriptions seen to trigger the aha moment (3? 5? 10?) [?]

**Primary metric:** % of new users who see a populated subscription list (3+ subscriptions with total) within their first session, via either path
**Target:** 35-40% within 24h [? hypothesis - revised down slightly from v1's 40% to account for harder privacy-first path]

**v_refresh MVP product decision:** Build two explicit activation paths with equal visual weight at the start of onboarding. Measure path split from day 1. Bank path: fast, auto-detect, trust-barrier at entry. Privacy path: slower, manual + AI assist, no bank required. Both converge on the same Guided Reveal aha moment.

## Retention

**Channels and mechanics:**
- Email: weekly "subscription digest" - upcoming renewals, total for the month, one notable change
- Push notifications (web push): price change alert, payment failure, trial ending alert, new subscription detected
- In-app return hooks: "Your Netflix price went up" visible on next login
- Monthly insight: "Here's what you committed to this month vs last month"
- Cancel assist prompt: "You haven't used X in a while - here's how to cancel it in 2 steps"
- NEW: Home screen widget (ambient presence on device, no need to open the app). Evidence: ReSubs uses widgets as a key retention mechanic. Bobby uses widgets. Ambient visibility keeps the product "alive" between sessions. Source: [resubs.app](https://resubs.app/), [bobbyapp.co](https://bobbyapp.co/)
- NEW: Cancel guide as a return hook. When a user views a cancel guide (step-by-step instructions for cancelling a specific service), they are actively in the job. Returning after they complete the cancel is a high-value touchpoint. ReSubs validates this with 30+ cancel guides. Source: [resubs.app](https://resubs.app/)

**Key hypotheses:**
1. A weekly email digest is the highest-ROI retention mechanic. Users who receive it return at 2x the rate of those who don't [? hypothesis]
2. Price change alerts are the single best push notification because they are genuinely useful, not marketing. They create a "Tendd caught that before I did" trust moment [? hypothesis]
3. Users who cancel at least one subscription via Tendd in the first 30 days have dramatically higher 90-day retention because they feel the product delivered its promise [? hypothesis]
4. NEW: Widget adoption is a stronger retention predictor than push notification opt-in for this audience, because the widget provides ambient value without requiring the user to open the app [? hypothesis]. Evidence: Bobby and ReSubs both prioritize widgets. PocketGuard's daily "safe to spend" number is a similar ambient mechanic that drives daily return. Source: [pocketguard.com](https://pocketguard.com/)

**What's unknown:**
- Optimal email digest frequency (weekly vs bi-weekly) [?]
- Whether free users or paid users respond better to price-change push notifications [?]
- Widget adoption rate for web apps (PWA) vs native apps [?]

**Primary metric:** 30-day retention rate
**Target:** 30% free / 60% paid [? hypothesis]

**v_refresh MVP product decision:** Ship the weekly email digest on day 1 (unchanged). ADD: build home screen widget (PWA) early - this is validated as a retention mechanic by both Bobby and ReSubs. Widget content: next renewal date + monthly total. Cancel guides: build at least 10 for the most common subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, Adobe, Amazon Prime, Gym memberships) at launch.

## Revenue

**Channels and mechanics:**
- Freemium conversion: free users hit the 10-subscription limit or want a premium feature
- Upgrade triggers: paywall encountered at high-motivation moments (forgotten subscription found, price increase detected)
- Pricing v_refresh: $6 to $10/month or $50 to $80/year [? hypothesis - revised UP from original $4-6/mo]. Evidence: PocketGuard charges $12.99/mo (1M+ users), YNAB charges $14.99/mo (paid-only, 500K+ users), ReSubs has a lifetime option alongside monthly. The market tolerates higher prices than the original hypothesis assumed. Source: [pocketguard.com/pricing](https://pocketguard.com/pricing), [ynab.com/pricing](https://ynab.com/pricing)
- Annual discount: 2 months free (standard SaaS incentive, unchanged)
- NEW: Lifetime plan option. ReSubs' one-time purchase model reduces churn anxiety for users who dislike subscriptions about subscriptions (ironic but validated). Source: [resubs.app](https://resubs.app/)
- NEW: Cancel guides as a paid-tier feature. Step-by-step cancel instructions for specific services (Netflix, Adobe, gym memberships) are a concrete, tangible premium feature. ReSubs offers 30+ such guides. Source: [resubs.app](https://resubs.app/)

**Key hypotheses:**
1. The highest-converting upgrade trigger is the moment after discovering a forgotten subscription. "You found a subscription you forgot about - upgrade to unlock your full history and cancel it in 2 steps" [? hypothesis]
2. Annual billing will account for 40 to 60% of paid users because the annual price feels like "less than one cancelled subscription pays for the year" [? hypothesis]
3. NEW: $7.99/month is closer to the optimal price point than the original $4.99 hypothesis, based on PocketGuard and YNAB pricing evidence. Requires user research to validate [? hypothesis]
4. NEW: The lifetime plan option will convert a meaningful share (5-15%) of buyers who have an emotional resistance to paying monthly for something that tracks their subscriptions [? hypothesis]. This is a unique positioning angle.

**What's unknown:**
- Actual willingness to pay for this audience (requires user research) [?]
- Whether the 10-subscription free limit is the right trigger or whether cancel guides access is more motivating [?]
- Whether offering a lifetime plan cannibalizes monthly revenue or expands the buyer pool [?]

**Primary metric:** Free-to-paid conversion rate
**Target:** 6 to 10% of active free users within 90 days [? hypothesis - revised UP from 5-8% to reflect higher price confidence]

**v_refresh MVP product decision:** The free tier must feel genuinely useful (not crippled). Limit by quantity (subscriptions), not quality. REVISED: launch at $7.99/month or $69/year (hypothesis) rather than $4.99 - competitor data suggests room for a higher price if the product delivers clear value. Include cancel guides (top 10 services) as a Pro-only feature to give the upgrade a concrete, immediately useful benefit.

## Referral

**Channels and mechanics:**
- Shareable subscription snapshot: a card or screenshot users can share ("I pay for 14 subscriptions - $247/month")
- Partner invite: "Track subscriptions together" shared household feature
- Word of mouth trigger: the surprise moment when a user sees their full monthly total
- App store reviews: prompted after a user successfully cancels a subscription
- NPS survey at day 30
- NEW: Privacy-safe snapshot. The shareable card must work for privacy-first users (path B) as well as bank-connected users. It should show subscription count + total spend, but never bank name, account number, or transaction details. This makes sharing feel safe and removes a likely barrier for path B users. Evidence: ReSubs' entire audience is privacy-conscious, yet it still has 18K+ users (word of mouth works in this segment). Source: [resubs.app](https://resubs.app/)
- NEW: Cancel success as the most shareable moment. "I just cancelled 3 subscriptions and saved $47/month using Tendd" is a stronger referral hook than "I see my subscriptions." The cancel moment combines financial relief + social proof + concrete number. Evidence: this pattern is consistent with how Rocket Money positions its cancellation service in marketing. Source: [rocketmoney.com](https://rocketmoney.com/)

**Key hypotheses:**
1. The "subscription count reveal" is inherently shareable because it is surprising and relatable - same emotional hook as Spotify Wrapped [? hypothesis]
2. Users who cancel at least one subscription via Tendd are the most likely to recommend because they have a concrete, story-worthy outcome [? hypothesis]
3. A formal referral program (give $X, get $X) is less effective than making the product itself shareable for this audience - they respond to authentic outcomes, not discount mechanics [? hypothesis]
4. NEW: The privacy-first snapshot card is essential for referral - without it, path B users cannot share their result without revealing bank data, which they will refuse to do [? hypothesis]

**What's unknown:**
- Whether users are comfortable sharing subscription totals publicly (even without bank details) [?]
- Whether partner invite drives meaningful volume in the MVP timeframe [?]
- NPS benchmark for this category [?]

**Primary metric:** Referral rate (% of new signups from an existing user referral)
**Target:** 15 to 20% of new signups from referrals within 6 months [? hypothesis - unchanged from v1]

**v_refresh MVP product decision:** Build the privacy-safe shareable snapshot card (no bank data, just count + total + optional monthly savings). Trigger the share prompt after the cancel moment, not at onboarding. Add app store review prompt post-cancellation. Formal referral program (discount mechanics) is post-MVP.

## Key Product Takeaways

1. **Activation is everything.** The entire product experience should be designed around one goal: getting a user to the "subscription list reveal" as quickly and calmly as possible. Every step that delays that moment is a conversion killer.

2. **Trust unlocks activation.** Bank connection is the fastest path to value, but only if the user trusts the product enough to do it. Trust-building language, privacy explainers, and transparency must come before the connection prompt, not after. This is the single biggest UX gap competitors leave open.

3. **Retention is built on notifications done right.** The weekly digest and price-change alerts are not features - they are the core retention engine. Useful and calm, not pushy or frequent. One genuinely helpful alert beats ten promotional ones. Widget + cancel guides are now validated mechanics to add early.

4. **The cancel moment is the revenue moment.** The upgrade trigger is most powerful immediately after a user finds a forgotten subscription or sees a price increase. The product must detect and surface these moments and connect them directly to the upgrade flow. Cancel guides as a Pro feature give the paywall a concrete, tangible reason to upgrade.

5. **NEW: Two paths are better than one.** Competitor research (ReSubs, 18K+ users, no bank connection required) validates that the privacy-first audience is real and reachable. Offering both activation paths with equal visual weight is not a fallback - it is a deliberate expansion of the addressable market. The paths must converge on the same aha moment, and the shareable snapshot must work for both. Source: [resubs.app](https://resubs.app/)
