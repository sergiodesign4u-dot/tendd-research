# CLAUDE.md - Tendd Product Brief

## Product Overview

**Name:** Tendd (placeholder - not validated for trademark)
**Type:** Mobile-first responsive web app, scaling to desktop
**One-sentence pitch:** Tendd helps people who are not into finance see and control their recurring payments and subscriptions, turning money anxiety into calm, everyday clarity.

**Core differentiator:** Tendd is NOT a budgeting app. It is a calm, low-friction visibility and control layer for recurring spend - built specifically for people who feel anxious about money and avoid finance apps because they feel overwhelming or judgmental.

**Platform:** Mobile-first responsive web. Native app is a later-stage decision and is out of scope for this phase.

## Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) Analysis

### Candidate Jobs (4-6)

| # | Job | Frequency | Intensity | Willingness to Pay | Score |
|---|-----|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| J1 | See all subscriptions in one place | Very High | High | High | 9/10 |
| J2 | Feel calm and in control of recurring money | High | Very High | High | 9/10 |
| J3 | Cancel subscriptions I no longer use | Medium-High | High | High | 8/10 |
| J4 | Get alerted when a price changes or payment fails | Medium | High | Medium | 7/10 |
| J5 | Understand what a charge on my statement actually is | High | High | Medium | 7/10 |
| J6 | Track shared subscriptions with a partner or family | Low-Medium | Medium | Medium | 5/10 |

### Primary JTBD

**J1 + J2 are deeply linked and form the combined primary job:**

> "When I suspect I'm paying for things I forgot about or never use, I want to see all my recurring charges clearly in one calm view, so that I feel in control of my money without needing to become a finance person."

### Secondary JTBD

**J3 - Cancel and save:**
> "When I am looking to reduce my monthly spend, I want to quickly identify which subscriptions I actually use vs which ones I keep forgetting to cancel, so that I can free up money without a complicated process."

**J4 - Stay ahead of surprises:**
> "When a subscription price changes or a payment fails, I want to be notified immediately in plain language, so that I am never caught off guard by an unexpected charge."

## Target Audience

- **Age range:** 22 to 42 years old (core: 26 to 36)
- **Financial confidence level:** Low to medium. These users know money matters but find finance apps stressful or confusing. They are not financially illiterate - they are financially anxious.
- **Trust level:** Skeptical. They are cautious about connecting bank accounts and sharing financial data. Trust must be earned through transparency and design, not just claimed.
- **Primary emotional driver:** Reducing financial anxiety. The feeling they want is: "I know what's going out, and I'm okay."
- **Secondary emotional driver:** Pride in small wins - catching a forgotten subscription, saving money, feeling on top of things.
- **What they are NOT:** Power users, budget optimizers, spreadsheet fans, financial planners.

## Business Model Hypothesis

**Model:** Freemium SaaS

**Free tier:** Enough to feel the core value - seeing your subscriptions clearly. Designed to build trust before asking for payment.

**Paid tier:** Tendd Pro, priced at approximately $4 to $6 per month (hypothesis - to be validated). Value proposition: "Pay less per month than most of the subscriptions you'll cancel."

**Assumption:** The free tier drives organic discovery and trust-building. Conversion to paid is triggered by hitting the subscription limit or wanting cancel support features.

**Secondary revenue (later stage):** Affiliate commissions on subscription cancellation recommendations. Not in MVP.

## Geography

**Primary markets:** United States and Europe (UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, Nordics)
**Global:** Accessible globally from launch, but support and compliance focus is US + EU first
**Regulatory note:** EU open banking (PSD2) and US bank connectivity (Plaid) have different data models. This is a meaningful architectural consideration.

## Design Principles

1. **Calm over clever.** Every screen should lower anxiety, not raise it. Avoid red, urgent language, and visual complexity. Prefer soft neutrals, generous whitespace, and a reassuring tone.

2. **One thing at a time.** Do not show users 10 things at once. Progressive disclosure is the default. The most important number is always the biggest thing on screen.

3. **Plain money language.** Never use financial jargon. "You're paying for 14 subscriptions" not "Monthly recurring expenditure: $247.83." Numbers are always in context.

4. **Trust through transparency.** Explain what you do with data, every time. Show the source of every figure. Never be vague about money.

5. **Small wins feel good.** Design for the moment when a user finds a forgotten subscription or saves money. That moment is the product's most important emotional beat.

## Tech Stack Hypothesis

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React) with Tailwind CSS - mobile-first, responsive
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes + Node.js (or separate Express service for complex integrations)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase or PlanetScale for managed hosting)
- **Auth:** Clerk or NextAuth.js
- **Bank data (US):** Plaid Link
- **Bank data (EU):** TrueLayer or Nordigen (now Powens/GoCardless Open Banking)
- **Payments:** Stripe (subscriptions)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend) + Railway or Render (backend services)
- **Notifications:** Resend (email) + web push via service worker
- **Analytics:** PostHog (privacy-friendly, EU-compliant)
